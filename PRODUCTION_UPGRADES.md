# Production Upgrades Implemented

## ✅ 1. Shimmer Loading Skeletons

**Components Added:**
- `src/components/Shimmer.tsx` - Animated shimmer effect component
- `src/components/SkeletonCard.tsx` - Pre-built skeleton card for lists

**Updated Screens:**
- `DocumentsScreen` - Shows 6 skeleton cards while loading documents
- `SearchScreen` - Shows 5 skeleton cards while performing searches

**Features:**
- Smooth animated gradient loading states
- Consistent sizing with real content cards
- Improved perceived performance during async operations

## ✅ 2. Rate Limiting + Exponential Backoff

**Implementation:**
- `embedWithBackoff()` function in `documentProcessing.ts`
- 150ms base delay between embedding calls
- Exponential backoff: 200ms → 400ms → 800ms → 1600ms
- Randomized jitter (up to 120ms) to prevent thundering herd
- Automatic retry for 429 (rate limit) and 5xx (server) errors
- Maximum 4 retry attempts before failing

**Benefits:**
- Prevents API rate limit hits during bulk document processing
- Graceful handling of temporary server issues
- Consistent pacing for reliable embedding generation

## ✅ 3. Sentry Integration

**Setup:**
- `src/utils/sentry.ts` - Sentry initialization and error reporting
- `@sentry/react-native` dependency added
- Automatic initialization on app start

**Error Reporting:**
- Document store errors: `document.addFromPicker`, `document.addImageForOcr`, `document.remove`
- Chat store errors: `chat.send`
- Contextual tags for debugging (`where` field)
- Silent error reporting (no user impact)

**Configuration:**
- DSN configured in `app.json` extra field
- 20% performance tracing sample rate
- Ready for production with proper Sentry project setup

## ✅ 4. Unit Tests

**Test Suite:**
- Jest configuration with `jest-expo` preset
- Tests in `__tests__/utils.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- `chunkText()` function:
  - Verifies 500-char chunking with 50-char overlap
  - Tests edge case with short strings
  - Validates chunk boundary consistency
- `cosine()` function:
  - Identical vector similarity (should equal 1.0)
  - Orthogonal vector similarity (should equal 0.0)
  - Symmetry and scale invariance properties

**Usage:**
```bash
npm test
```

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install new dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Sentry (optional but recommended):**
   - Update `SENTRY_DSN` in `app.json` with your actual Sentry project DSN
   - Or leave empty to disable Sentry in development

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Production Checklist
